# LBU-LTI

This project is a Java library which supports the creation of LTI tools.

##  Status

The library provides minimal functionality to support the lbu-lti-demo project. The design is subject to major changes as the author better understands LTI 1.3 and what this library needs to do to make tool creation as simple as possible.

The code has not been exhaustively tested for security loopholes. Comments on security issues would be very welcome. Pull requests that address such issues would be even more welcome.

## Using this library

This library has now been published in Maven Central.
