# LBU-LTI

This project is a Java library which supports the creation of LTI tools.

##  Status

The library provides minimal functionality to support the lbu-lti-demo project. The design is subject to major changes as the author better understands LTI 1.3 and what this library needs to do to make tool creation as simple as possible.

The code has not been exhaustively tested for security loopholes. Comments on security issues would be very welcome. Pull requests that address such issues would be even more welcome.

## Using this library

This library has not been published in Maven Central yet so packages are only available from github and cannot be fetched anonymously. However, the packages are public so any authenticated user on github.com can access them. This means you need an account on GitHub and you need to create a GitHub personal access token. Then in your build you need to set up the package repository and specify authentication with your GitHub user name and the personal access token in place of a password.
